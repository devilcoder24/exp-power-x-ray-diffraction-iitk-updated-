In the diffractogram given in <b>Figure 2</b> for an unknown material, the following procedure is adhered: <br><br>

<b>Steps :</b> <br>

1. Firstly, the 2θ values where diffraction occurred are obtained,  <br>
2. Subsequently, the corresponding θ, sin θ and sin<sup>2</sup>θ values for all the peaks are noted, <br>
3. The ratios of sin<sup>2</sup>θ value of all the peaks with respect to the first peak is obtained, <br>
4. Finally, the obtained ratios are multiplied by a suitable integer to convert all these ratios into an integer. <br><br>

5. The distinction between lattices of the cubic system is possible by using the fact that not all combinations of h<sup>2</sup>+k<sup>2</sup>+l<sup>2</sup> lead to reflection for a given lattice. The ratio of h<sup>2</sup>+k<sup>2</sup>+l<sup>2</sup> values for allowed reflections from different crystals are as follows [3]: <br><br>
